# ImMobile Options

At the end of the **Home Tools** list, you'll find an item called **Options**. This tool provides quick access to various helpful actions such as:

- Clearing cache  
- Resetting the **home grid layout**  
- Launching **ImMobile Lab**, a deep monitoring utility for advanced users

---

### ImMobile Lab

A dedicated environment for inspecting internal systems like:

- Cached textures  
- Background intervals  
- And more low-level behaviors  

It also includes a very **early-stage HTML browser** that supports:

- CSS  
- Very limited (1%) JavaScript support  
- Can display core structure of websites along with images

> Intended for testing, not for full web browsing.

# ImMobile Tasks

ImMobile includes an **asynchronous, multi-tasking environment**, supporting up to **5 parallel task queues**. This allows for:

- Simultaneous task execution  
- Smooth background operations  
- Queued pending tasks (without noticeable delay in most cases)

---

### Task Monitor

Access the **Tasks** tool from the ImMobile home screen to:

- View **currently running tasks**  
- Monitor **background**, **failed**, and **finished** tasks  
- Read error messages in failed tasks for better debugging

> A **"Cancel" button** is available, but currently tasks like downloads are **not yet cancellable**.  
> This will be improved in future updates, but does **not affect extensions or app stability**.

# ImMobile Logs

The **Logs** section is valuable for troubleshooting and understanding internal operations.

You may see log entries such as:

- File access warnings — normal during file resolution attempts
- Configuration checks — e.g., verifying the existence of a config file

These logs typically reflect **routine operations**, not critical errors.

# Extra Tools

ImMobile bundles several small but useful tools into one place:

- Calculator  
- Stocks Viewer  
- Lightweight Text Editor  
- Hex Editor

These tools are great for quick tasks without leaving the app.

# Device Information

ImMobile also provides detailed information about your device, including:

- System Overview  
- CPU & Core Count  
- RAM (Memory) Details  
- Network Status

This info can be helpful for diagnostics, optimization, or debugging your environment.
